# MyDailyExpenseTracker
A web app for tracking all your daily and monthly expenses

index.html :
  Home page of app where we can see our monthly and daily graphical reports to keep a track where we are spending more/less.
  At the moment it is empty as i havent attached database to it yet.
  
expenses.html :
  We have many categories like food,entertainment,grocery etc. to mark down our expenses. Some which are not listed are supposed
  to go under miscellaneous tab like new gadget purchase or lending money to friend etc.
  
bills.html :
  this page will have categories listed which all of us pay every month like internet bill, phone bill, TV recharge bill,
  EMI, etc.

investments.html :
  I have made a different tab for it because when we invest we are not sure we will lose our money or earn extra money on it.
  So when we spend/invest money on mutual fund, stock market etc we can add them to this section and later on can record the
  outcome in income tab.
 
income.html :
  I have included this tab as this will record all our income coming from different sources like monthly salary, ecommerce,
  dropshipping etc.
  Having this tab can let us know how much we earn and how much we spend. By subtracting all expenses and bills from income
  we can find out what we are left with at the end of the month.
